# TM-s-Summarizer-Policy-Generator

This is a Flask-based web application that uses OpenAI's GPT models to **summarize documents** and **generate policy documents** based on user-provided scenarios. It features a modern UI with interactive functionality for file uploads and prompt-based policy generation.

## üöÄ Features

- **Document Summarizer**: Upload `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.json`, or image files (`.png`, `.jpg`) to extract and summarize content.
- **Policy Generator**: Enter a scenario or context, and the AI generates a detailed, structured policy with key points.
- **Basic Fallback Logic**: When the OpenAI API fails (e.g. rate limits), a simpler extractive summary or policy framework is provided.
- **Expandable UI**: Frontend includes placeholders for future tools like an Inquiry Classifier and Product Name Generator.

## üß© Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python 3, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 / GPT-4 via OpenAI API
- **OCR**: Tesseract (via `pytesseract` for image text extraction)
- **Document Parsing**: `pdfplumber`, `python-docx`

## üõ°Ô∏è Notes
The API uses gpt-3.5-turbo by default. You can switch to gpt-4 if needed.

API calls are limited by token count and rate limits. Basic fallback summaries/policies are provided if those limits are hit.

Frontend supports switching between tools, although only Summarizer and Generator are currently active.
